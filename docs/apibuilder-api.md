# APIs

## What do I see?

You're seeing the first page of the API Builder.

## What's an API?

An API is such as a content type (ex: `article`, `category`, `comment`).
You can linked modules together with some relations (ex: an article can have
many comments). An API allows you to create, read, update or delete an entry
(ex: an article).

For developers: An API is composed by its own routes, controllers, models,
templates and policies. When you are using our API Builder, it will create RESTful CRUD API.
